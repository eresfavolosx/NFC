## 2025-02-18 - Prevent DOM-based XSS in Toast notifications
**Vulnerability:** The `showToast` function in `src/utils.js` (and similarly previously in `src/components/toast.js`) was interpolating user-controlled message strings directly into `innerHTML`, creating a critical DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
**Learning:** This existed because standard string interpolation (``) was used within `innerHTML` to construct the toast component, missing the escaping layer.
**Prevention:** Always use `textContent` to inject user-provided text into dynamically created DOM nodes, or ensure robust escaping via regex-based `escapeHTML` if HTML formatting is strictly required.## 2025-02-20 - Unescaped HTML Interpolation in Modal Component String Templates

**Vulnerability:** User-controlled data properties (`link.id`, `link.icon`, `link.title`) were directly interpolated into string templates that were then passed to a generic modal component (`openModal`) without escaping, leading to potential DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Learning:** `openModal` sets its content argument directly to `.innerHTML`. When generic views like the "redirect" activation screen create `<select>` dropdowns using dynamic content from the store (`store.links`), this dynamic content acts as an attack vector.
**Prevention:** Always use the utility `escapeHTML` to wrap any dynamic, user-provided string properties when building string templates intended for insertion into `.innerHTML` or `.content` properties of generic view components.

## 2026-04-13 - Unescaped Variables in DOM Modals
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled data (emails, item names, icon strings) was directly interpolated into HTML strings inside multiple views before being passed to `openModal()` which uses `innerHTML`.
**Learning:** Passing dynamic strings without explicit escaping into generalized rendering methods exposes DOM-based XSS vectors.
**Prevention:** Apply the `escapeHTML` utility to all dynamic variables generated from user data (even simple properties like `l.icon` or iterators like `e`) within template string literals used for innerHTML assignments.
